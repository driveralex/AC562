# Personal project summary

My personal project will explore 2 problematics related to the practical work previously executed:

### 1/ About the voter model
First, we will try to push further the effect of different strategies on the result of an election. To do so we plan to complexify a bit the model build for Mickey and Robert to get closer to reality. We plan to add at least 2 attributes for our nodes: the age, and a more complex media of preference (social network, TV, etcâ€¦). We will try to implement some rules between those features and see how we can modify the votes by influencing the media and try to see how the population responds. 
The last interesting effect to studies in this model will be about the mechanism of how the candidates are elected. We will try to implement a system close to the one used in the USA with the winner of the state that takes all the votes.
This part will be the social aspects.

### 2/ About the epidemic model
We try to see the effect of vaccination on the spread of the disease. We will try different strategies to percolate the network and study how they perform. We will try to have the same result as shown in the lectures.
This part will be more focused on math.
